# NewsSummary - Sentiment Analysis Python Script

**Project Description:** This is a simple NLTK-based Python script that will allow the user to enter a URL for a news article in a GUI created by Tkinter. 
Using Natural Language Processing, the article is then analyzed to provide insight into its sentiment, polarity, and more. It uses the Newspaper library as a
web scraping tool in order to quickly read the article. 

**List of used libraries:** 
  Tkinter
  NLTK

  1. download the main.py file and open it in the code editor of your choice.
  2. Check python and pip installations.
